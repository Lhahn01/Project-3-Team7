# Note:
_Asymptotic Analysis (fixed s)_ is where the elements of a set vary but they all equal 500. As for _Asymptotic Analysis (random s)_, this is where I test where both the elements and the sum of everything vary as long as _n_ is 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18. The experimental result was received by just calculating the start and end of the code in nanoseconds. The theoretical result was received by calculating the sum from the random array and multiplying that with the _n_ value.
